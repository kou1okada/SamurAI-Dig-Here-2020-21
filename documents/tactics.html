    <h2>Dog Tactics</h2>
    <h3>Barking Timelily</h3>
    <p>
      The dog should move to the cell with hidden treasure and bark
      only when the friend samurai can reach the cell earlier than the
      opponent samurai.  Otherwise, the dog can stroll around waiting
      for an opportunity.
    </p>
    <h3>Covering the Treasure</h3>
    <p>
      While the dog is staying in the cell with treasure,
      the opponent samurai cannot dig it up.
      The dog may stay on the cell for the friend samurai to come closer.
    </p>
    <h3>Reporting Treasures without Barking</h3>
    <p>
      The dog may show some unusual maneuver arranged beforehand, such
      as repeating moves back and forth, to inform the position of
      some treasure without barking on the cell only to the friend
      samurai.
    </p>
    <h3>Interfering Opponents' Moves</h3>
    <p>
      Interfering moves of opponent agents by blocking their routes is
      a conceivable tactic.  Especially, as dogs have more freedom in
      their moves than samurai, interfering moves of the opponent
      samurai may be effective.
    </p>
    <h3>Collecting as Much Information as Possible</h3>
    <p>
      The dog can gather more information on hidden treasure by moving
      to the area where it has not visited.
    </p>
    <h2>Samurai Tactics</h2>
    <h3>Keeping Close to the Dog</h3>
    <p>
      The samurai should stay close to the dog to be able to rapidly
      approach the treasures found by the dog.
    </p>
    <h3>Confining the Opponent Dog</h3>
    <p>
      Dogs cannot fill a hole, and thus cannot move out of an area
      completely surrounded by cells with holes and field edges
      without help of the samurai.
      Samurai may dig holes around the position of the enemy dogs to
      make it confined in an narrow area.  This may be most effective
      on corners of the field.
    </p>
    <h3>Freeing the Friend Dog</h3>
    <p>
      Freeing the dog confined in a narrow area by filling one of the
      holes surround the area might be effective.
