    <h2>Qualifying Round System</h2>
    <p>
      The qualifying round is conducted as a round-robin tournament,
      in which all the participating teams play one match (two games
      exchanging the initial positions of the agents) against all the
      other teams, as long as the number of participating teams allows
      it.  If the number of teams is too many for a single round-robin
      tournament, the qualification round will be organized with two
      stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a two-stage qualifier, participating teams are divided into
      several groups for the first stage.  A round-robin tournament is
      conducted in each of the groups.  Around 30 teams with higher
      ranks in the first-stage groups are advanced to the final
      qualifier, which is conducted as a round-robin tournament again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the limited time and resource, the numbers of teams in
      each of the first stage are restricted to at most
      around 30.  The number of teams for the first stage groups are
      averaged as far as possible.  The same number of teams are
      advanced to the final qualifier from each group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an example of the organization of the qualifying round with
      different number of participating teams.
