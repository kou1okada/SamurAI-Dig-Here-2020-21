    <h2>Game Field</h2>
    <p>
      The game field is divided into grid-aligned cells.
    </p>

    <img src="screenShots/agents.png" width="22%" class="figure">
    <h3>Agents</h3>
    <p>
      Four agents, one samurai and one dog for each side,
      are initially located on some of the distinct cells of the game field.
    </p>
    <img src="screenShots/energized.png" width="13%" class="figure">
    <p>
      Agents can move to one of the neighboring cells in a single game step,
      or can also choose to stay on the same cell.
      Dogs can move to any of the <em>eight</em> neighboring cells.
      Samurai can usually move only one of the <em>four</em> neighboring cells,
      however, when they take a rest, they can move to any of
      the eight <em>neighbors</em> in the step immediately following.
      Samurai in such a state are colored more brightly.
    </p>

    <img src="screenShots/holes.png" width="17%" class="figure">
    <h3>Holes</h3>
    <p>
      Initially, some of the cells in the game field have a hole,
      preventing game agents from stepping into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samurai can dig a new hole or plug a new hole in a neighboring cell.
      Usually, one of the four neighboring cells are the target of digging
      or plugging, however, in the step immediately after a rest step,
      any of the eight neighboring cells can be the target.
      Dogs can do neither.
    </p>

    <img src="screenShots/hidden-gold.png" width="20%" class="figure">
    <h3>Buried Treasure</h3>
    <p>
      Some of the cells have certain amounts of buried treasure.
      Positions and amounts of some of them are already known
      initially, while some are not.
      The objective of the game is to dig out more treasure than the opponent.
      Samurai can dig out the buried treasure in neighboring cells
      by digging new holes there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogs on one of the eight neighboring cells can detect the
      existence and the amount of the buried treasure.
      When a dog is on a cell with buried treasure,
      the position and the amount of the treasure is revealed to
      <em>all the agents of both teams.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Importing a Game Log</h2>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>import button</em>
      <img src="../icons/import.png" class="inlineIcon">
      on top of the screen,
      a window for selecting a file to import pops up.
      A game log is imported by choosing a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that, when the game log is updated after importing, loading
      the same file expecting the updated one to be loaded may fail,
      because the browser sticks to the cache kept on the first
      import, that is, the version before the update.  Reloading the
      whole web page by the reload feature of the browser may solve
      the problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Automatic Play Mode</h2>
    <p>
      The initial play mode is <em>automatic.</em>  In the automatic
      mode, game steps recorded in the game log loaded are visualized,
      and steps beyond what are recorded are automatically generated
      with agent moves chosen by players built in the system.  The
      generated moves are appended to the game record.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game progresses controlled by some of the buttons on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="screenShots/control-buttons.png" width="25%" class="figure">
      Buttons on the top left and their functions are as follows.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>rewind button</em>

	</li>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>play button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/play.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  starts automatic playback that repetitively displays
	  the following steps in a constant pace
	  until the end of the game is reached.
	  The button changes its form to
	  <img src="../icons/stop.png" class="inlineIcon">,
	  clicking which stops the playback.
	  When the end of the plays in the recorded game is reached,
	  but the game is not ended yet,
	  following steps are automatically generated,
	  as stated above.
	  The speed of playback can be adjusted using the
	  <em>speedometer button</em>
	  explained below.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>step forward button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/stepForward.png" class="inlineIcon">

	</li>
	<li>
	  The <em>speedometer button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/speedometer.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  can be used to adjust the speed of playback.
	  The number displayed on its right indicates
	  the current playback speed in steps per minute (spm, in short).
	  Clicking the speedometer will decrease the speed by 4 spm,
	  or increase it by 4 spm if a shift key is pressed down.
	  The speed can also be adjusted by rotating the mouse wheel
	  while the mouse cursor is on the speedometer.
	  The maximum play speed is 240 spm and the minimum is 24.
	</li>
	<li>
	  As described above, a game log can be imported by clicking the
	  <em>import button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/import.png" class="inlineIcon">.
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="screenShots/right-buttons.png" width="30%" class="figure">

      <ul>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>edit button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/edit.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  starts the edit mode (described below).
	</li>
	<li>

	  total amount of buried treasure yet to be dug out.
	  This is the total of those hidden and revealed.
	</li>
	<li>
	  While pressing a mouse button the the <em>treasure icon</em>
	  <img src="../icons/coins-icon.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  coming next, the positions and the amounts of all the hidden
	  buried treasure in the game field are displayed with their
	  amounts in red figures.  Releasing the button makes them
	  hidden again.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The state of the game displayed can be advanced or
	  by mouse operation on the <em>clock icon</em>
	  <img src="../icons/clock.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  displayed on the top right of the screen.
	  Clicking the icon advances or rolls back the displayed state
	  by one step, depending whether or not a shift key is pressed.
	  Rotating the wheel up or down also advances or rolls back
	  the displayed state.
	  When a control key is pressed,
	  10 steps are advanced or rolled back at a time.
	  Neither going before the initial state nor
	  beyond the last recorded step is possible.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Two numbers coming next, separated by a slash symbol ('/')
	  shows the step number of the state currently displayed
	  and the maximum possible step number of the game.

      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="manualPlay">Manual Play Mode</h2>
    <p>
      In the manual play mode, one of the two samurai can be
      controlled manually.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting the Manual Play</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>manual play button</em>
      <img src="../icons/manual.png" class="inlineIcon">
      on the top right starts the manual play mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first click on the button makes the red samurai controlled
      manually.  The button changes its color to red
      <img src="../icons/red-hand.png" class="inlineIcon">.
      All the other agents, dogs and the blue samurai, are
      controlled by the built-in players.
      Another click makes the blue samurai under manual control,
      and changes the button color to blue
      <img src="../icons/blue-hand.png" class="inlineIcon">.
      The the red samurai is then controlled by the built-in player,
      as well as dogs.
      Still another click will revert the play mode to automatic,
      changing the button color back to the original white.
    </p>
    <img src="screenShots/manual-play1.png" width="20%" class="figure">
    <img src="screenShots/manual-play2.png" width="20%" class="figure">
    <h3>Manual Stepping</h3>
    <p>
      In the manual play mode, arrow symbols are displayed
      on cells around the manually controlled agent,
      showing possible plays.
      Clicking the cells marked with arrows tells the following.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  If a shift key is pressed when the cell is clicked,
	  the action indicated is either plugging a hole or digging a new one.
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      If the cell has a hole, the hole will be plugged up.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If the cell does not have a hole and with buried treasure,
	      whether or not it is already revealed,
	      the treasure is dug out.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If the cell does not have a hole and without any buried treasure,
	      a new hole is dug out in the cell.
	    </li>
	    Digging will not be done
	    if some other agent successfully moves on to that same cell.
	    Two samurai can dig the same cell at a time,
	    and treasure buried there, if any,
	    will be halved and shared by both sides.
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  If shift keys are <em>not</em> pressed when the cell is clicked,
	  the samurai tries to move onto that cell.
	  The action will be successful if the cell does not have a
	  hole and no other agents try to move to the same cell.
	</li>
      </ul>
      When the cell where the samurai stands is clicked,
      no actions are taken for that step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actions of the manually controlled samurai can also be told by
      pressing keys.
      The keys and their meaning are as follows.
      <img src="screenShots/keys.png" width="30%" class="figure">
      <table>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>y</tt></th>
	  <td>Upper left cell (&nwarr;)</td>
	  <th><tt>u</tt></th>
	  <td>Upper right cell (&nearr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>b</tt></th>
	  <td>Lower left cell (&swarr;)</td>
	  <th><tt>n</tt></th>
	  <td>Lower right cell (&searr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>h &larr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Left cell (&larr;)</td>
	  <th><tt>l &rarr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Right cell (&rarr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>k &uarr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Upper cell (&uarr;)</td>
	  <th><tt>j &darr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Lower cell (&darr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>.</tt> <em>space</em></th>
	  <td>Take a rest</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
      As with clicking on the screen.
      holding shift keys down means digging a new hole or
      plugging an already existing hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping manually deletes any play records of steps beyond the
      played step, and the result of the stepping is recorded as the
      last step.
    </p>
    <h3>Automatic Plays in the Manual Play Mode</h3>
    <p>
      Automatic plays can also be instructed in the manual play mode.
      Single step by the step forward button
      <img src="../icons/stepForward.png" class="inlineIcon">,
      and repetitive play by the play button
      <img src="../icons/play.png" class="inlineIcon">,
      are possible.
      When the play stops, the play mode is kept to be manual.
      Rolling back to the initial state by the rewind button
      <img src="../icons/rewind.png" class="inlineIcon">
      is also possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Edit Mode</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Edit mode</em> is enabled by clicking the <em>edit button</em>
      <img src="../icons/edit.png" class="inlineIcon">
      on top of the screen.
      The edit mode enables editing, saving, and loading the
      game log and/or configuration of the game field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following changes are made on the displayed screen.
      <ul>
	<li>The initial game state is displayed</li>
	<li>The background color becomes gray</li>
	<li>The buttons on top are replaced by those for editing</li>
	<li>The hidden buried treasure are made apparent, with their
	amounts in red</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <center>
      <img src="screenShots/edit-mode.png" width="75%">
    </center>
    <p>
      <img src="screenShots/cell-highlight.png" width="25%" class="figure">
      In the edit mode, the border of the cell with the mouse pointer
      becomes white, indicating that the cell is being edited.
      Any configuration changes discard all of the recorded play.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuring the Agents</h3>
    <p>
      Pressing a mouse button on a cell with an agent on it, and
      dragging the mouse moves the agent another cell.
      Agents cannot be moved to a cell with buried treasure or a hole;
      instead, the position will be the cell the mouse cursor was previously on.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a shift key is pressed when the mouse mouse button is pressed,
      the agent rotates clockwise.
      Note that, although this changes the appearance of the agent
      in the initial state, it has no influence on the game play.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuring Buried Treasure</h3>
    <p>
      The amount of buried treasure in a cell can be increased or
      decreased by clicking the mouse button on the cell.
      With a mouse click <em>without</em> pressing a shift key
      <em>decreases</em> the amount by 2.
      When the amount becomes 0, the buried treasure in the cell disappears.
      A mouse click while pressing a shift key <em>increases</em> the
      amount by 2.
      When the click is on a cell while pressing a
      shift key on a cell without any buried treasure,
      treasure of amount 2 is buried in the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mouse click on a cell with buried treasure while pressing a
      control key toggles the treasure initial status between apparent
      and hidden.  Amounts of hidden treasures are displayed in red
      figures while those of apparent ones are in yellow.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuring Holes</h3>
    <p>
      With a mouse click on a cell with a hole, it is plugged up.
      Otherwise, if the cell does not have any buried treasure,
      a new hole is dug out.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuring the Field Size</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>expand button</em>
      <img src="../icons/resize.png" class="inlineIcon">
      increments the number of cells in one side of the field.
      Clicking it with a shift key pressed down decrements it.
      The size cannot be made smaller than 6 nor larger than 20.
      Agents on cells lost on resize will be moved to some other cells.
      Any holes and buried treasures in the cells lost or on the cell
      to which an agent is moved will be lost.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuring the Maximum Number of Steps</h3>
    <p>
      The maximum number of steps of the game can be
      incremented or decremented by
      a mouse click or mouse wheel rotation on the <em>clock icon</em>
      <img src="../icons/clock.png" class="inlineIcon">
      while in the edit mode.
      Clicking the icon while pressing a shift key
      increments the maximum number of steps and
      decrements otherwise.
      Rotating the wheel up or down increments or decrements it
      respectively.
      When a control key is pressed, the change amount is multiplied by 10.
      It cannot be set to be less than 10.
    </p>
    <h3>Random Configuration</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>random configurations button</em>
      <img src="../icons/randomize.png" class="inlineIcon">
      makes a new random field configuration.
      Play logs, if any, will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a shift key is pressed on clicking, only the buried treasures
      (both hidden and known) are reconfigured at random, without
      changing the positions of agents and holes.
    </p>
    <h3>Clearing the Play Log</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>clear log button</em>
      <img src="../icons/clearLog.png" class="inlineIcon">
      discards play logs, if any, keeping the field configuration as is.
      This is meant for saving or exporting the field configuration
      without any play logs.
    </p>
    <h3>Saving and Loading the Game State</h3>
    <p>
      The current game state, that is,
      the configuration of the game field as well as the play log,
      can be saved to the storage of the browser
      for loading afterwards.
      This storage is kept in the browser of the system;
      Neither page reloading reload nor browser is restart
      will destroy the record.
      The record, however, cannot be accessed with other browsers
      or on other systems.

      randomly reconfigure the game field setting.
      Which game features to be randomized can be chosen can be chosen.
      There are four icons for agents

      holes <img src="../icons/hole.png" class="inlineIcon">,
      known treasures <img src="../icons/knownGold.png" class="inlineIcon">,
      and hidden treasures
      <img src="../icons/hiddenGold.png" class="inlineIcon">.
      Icons with red borders mean that the corresponding features are
      to be configured randomly.
      Others are kept without reconfiguration.
      Clicking these icons can toggle whether or not
      the features are to be configured.

    <h3>Probability of Holes</h3>
    <p>
      The field to the right of the hole icon is for setting the
      probability of holes in the game field cells on random
      configurations.
    </p>      
    <h3>Treasures</h3>
    <p>
      The two fields to the right of the known treasure icon are for
      setting parameters used in random reconfiguration of known treasures.
      The first one is for setting the probability of treasures in
      game field cells.  The next, labeled "max", is for setting the
      maximum amount of treasure in one cell.  This should be a positive
      even number.  If an odd number or a number less than 2 is
      specified, the value is adjusted to satisfy the constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two fields to the right of the hidden treasure icon
      are for setting parameters used in random reconfiguration of
      hidden treasures in the same manner.
    </p>
    <h3>Finishing the Setting</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the "Done" button will make the changes made take effect.
      Clicking the "Cancel" button will discard all the changes.
      Either will close the dialog.
